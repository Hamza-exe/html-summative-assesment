   <!--Intro Paragraph-->
    <u><h1><center>Welcome to Hamtendo's Restoration Shop!</center></h1></u>

    <p>Welcome to Hamtendo's Restoration Shop. This is a website that I created 
    for the purposes of my hoppy which is retro videogame collecting and restoration. 
    This website offers many resources such as my story, tutorials, and tips on collecting!
    This is angreat website for any beginner collector who wants to start collecting or wants 
    to restore parts of ther new collection. Everyone should start a sort of videogame collection 
    because it offers many benefits! They are both great investments and a really fun way to make
    money to! Retro videogames go up in value over time and one of those brands to really invest in 
    would be Nintendo! Nintendo products are a one of a kind! They always retain their value. An 
    example of this would be gamecube games that have all retained and even gained lots of value over 
    these past 20 years! So what are you waiting for? Go back to your childhood home and get your old 
    videogames and get into the Retro Videogame industry! </p>

    <!--My story in the retro videogame industry-->
    <u><h2>My Story</h2></u>

    <p>I had initially started retro videogame collecting in 2018 when my friend was clearing out 
    his house sold me his gamecube for $4. I didnt really get into retro collecting much until 
    september of 2020 when another friend of mine was also clearing out his house and sold me 
    his entire videogame collection of about 30 years for $30. This had really started me into 
    retro collecting and ever since ive been on the lookout for more nintendo products and other 
    retro videogame companies. Many of the consoles in my collection were defective and yellowed 
    from old age. This had started my journey of the restoration aspect of videogames. </p>

    <u><h2>My Intro to Repairing</h2></u>

    <p>When I 
    started opening the consoles, with no previous experience of repairing electronics, I just 
    tried to fix what seemed wrong. The first of these repairs was a normal gameboy from the 
    late 80's. My first repair was a success and from there I continued repairing and restoring 
    the consoles. You can see some pictures of the repairs and restorations Ive done below.</p>
